--------------Super Fancy Django App for Tracking U of I Salaries (and beyond)!---------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's gonna be rough getting up and running. 

create a python virtualenv named 'salary'
workon salary.

run 'pip install -r requirements.txt'

create a db:

createdb salary -T template_postgis -O salary

I use South for dev database migrations, because I hate writing postgres and I love having freetime. In any case, you will too:
python manage.py syncdb
python manage.py schemamigration salaries --initial
python manage.py migrate

load the data in the /salary directory:
python manage.py import_csv
python manage.py import_budgets
and then go into the shell to save all of the percentiles/whatever I've come up since I've last updated this README.

python manage.py shell
>>>from apps.salaries.models import *
#for each of the {{classes}}, you're going to want to do
>>>for e in {{class}}.objects.all():
>>>    e.save()

This will take a very long time. I am very sorry. It runs once, get over it, I wrote it for my own speed, not the computers. It is very bad. See you in two hours.

You're back!
Okay. Go develop. Push well and often.
